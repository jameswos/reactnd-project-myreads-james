# MyReads Project
Welcome to MyReads project! The 7th Project in Udacity's FEWD Nanodegree!
Keep track on the books you are 'Currently Reading', 'Want to Read' or have 'Read' all in one place!
Add new books by clicking on the '+' icon in the bottom right corner of the app and then selecting which shelf to add it to!
Reading + Organisation = Brilliant Combination! Yay!

## Prerequisites
You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.
* Git
* Node.js (with npm)

## Installation
* `git clone <repository-url>` this repository
* change into the new directory
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`


## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Contributing

This repository is my final submission for FEWD P7. Therefore, I most likely will not accept pull requests.

## Special Thanks!
I would like to extend a special thank you to Maeva NAP and her brilliant Study Jam session (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i6L2jLHV9j8)! I coded along with her the entire way! Couldn't have done it without her!
